# extraterrestrial-incursion

The process and execution of utilizing Pygame to focus on higher-level logic 
and create a basic game. 

In Extraterrestrial Incursion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears
at the bottom of the screen. The player can move the ship right and left using
arrow keys and shoot bulletts using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet
fills the sky and moves across and down the screen. The player shoots and 
destroys the aliens. If the player destroys all the aliens, a new fleet appears
that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the players ship
or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player
loses three ships, the game ends.
